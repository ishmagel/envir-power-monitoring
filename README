Program to export data from Envir to Fusion tables.

Files:

* fusion_exporter.py - Program to read from Envir db and send to Fusion tables.
* charts.html - HTML page for visualising data from Fusion table.
* cron - File to set up cron job for running exporter regularly.

Steps:

1. Create two Fusion tables; one for Power and one for Temperature.
  a. For Power, make a copy of this template: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1dbVgYcR-oMjkI72bNP_JIoO7486xW3CDxZVLEaU
     Add/Remove ch* columns to fit your setup.
  b. For Temperature, make a copy of this template: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?docid=1yFM-hTszcGJa2UMLSCSTxiQvHDH1AbOp5L2vUqo

2. Create folder on the server where the Envir database resides and check out the code.

4. Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console.

4. Enable Fusion Tables API in Services.

5. Create an OAuth 2.0 account in Accounts.

6. Click "Download JSON" and save "client_secrets.json" in the same folder.

7. Modify "fusion-exporter.py" and "charts.html" as documented in the files.

8. Run the exporter once: "python fusion_exporter.py". You should now see data in the Fusion tables.

9. Set up a cron job by running "crontab cron".

10. Open charts.html in your browser and see the results.
